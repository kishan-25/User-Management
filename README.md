📚 API Reference
This application uses the Reqres API with the following endpoints:

Authentication: POST /api/login

Get Users: GET /api/users?page={page_number}

Update User: PUT /api/users/{id}

Delete User: DELETE /api/users/{id}

🔧 Environment Setup
No environment variables are required to run this application as it uses a public API.

📱 Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive and works well on:

Desktop devices

Tablets

Mobile phones

🤔 Assumptions and Considerations
The Reqres API is a demo API that simulates real backend responses but doesn't actually modify data on the server

Deleted users will appear again if you refresh the page as changes aren't persisted on the server

The token provided by the API doesn't expire in this demo version
